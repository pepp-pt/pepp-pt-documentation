# PEPP-PT Documentation

## What is PEPP-PT?

The purpose of the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT)
approach is to provide a common basis for management systems that can be
integrated into national public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The
PEPP-PT approach is being created by a multi-national European team.  It is
a privacy-preserving digital proximity-tracing approach, which is in full
compliance with GDPR and can also be used when traveling between countries.

## Documentation

- [PEPP-PT Data Protection and Information Security Architecture: Illustrated on German Implementation](./PEPP-PT-data-protection-information-security-architecture.pdf)

The building blocks will be published as separate documents step by step as we
complete the editing process.

## Open source strategy

PEPP-PT is preparing a number of source code repositories to be open sourced.

These repositories include:

* Backend services
* Android application core libraries
* Android application reference implementation
* iOS application core libraries
* iOS application reference implementation

Our goal when open sourcing the code is to be transparent and establish
a dialog with the community.  Through this transparency and ongoing discussion,
our hope is to build trust and ensure any concerns raised are resolved before
solutions based on PEPP-PT are released to the general public.

## Contributing

The project is currently not accepting contributions but aims to do so in the
near future.
